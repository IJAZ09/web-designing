 <p style="font-size: x-large;"> First term in clarity comes is   <b>visual clarity </b>. If content is visual use of appropriate colour ad text font make and web page much more clear
 and nice to look into it. <b>As an example </b> if a product selling website is full of content and other stuff but is not clear about it pupose of selling that particular niche is
 useless. Beacuse that website purpose is not clear and will not make any sale on the other hand a website show clear view of product and advertise that product nicely with clear
 customer rewiew will make more sales and will have positive customer feedback then the first sale store. <br> <br>
